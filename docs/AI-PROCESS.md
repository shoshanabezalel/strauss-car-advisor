# AI-PROCESS — log of working with AI tools

Per milestone: what I asked, how (plan mode / subagent / MCP), what came out, where the AI was wrong and how I caught it, decisions taken.

## Tools
- Claude Code (development), Gemini Flash / Claude Haiku (inside the product), Supabase MCP, Playwright MCP

## Log
### M0 — Setup (17/10/2026)
- **How:** plan mode → approval → scaffold Next.js 16 + shadcn (RTL), Zod schemas for data/*.json (tests first, 31 unit tests), Supabase clients, migration `0001_init.sql` applied through Supabase MCP `apply_migration`, Playwright config + smoke test (RTL + config loaded), `.env.example`, README, Stop hook running `npm test`.
- **Verification:** `list_tables` (6 tables, RLS on), `get_advisors security` (no lints), `npm run check:db` (service + publishable keys), `npm test`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `test:e2e` (which also boots `npm run dev`).
- **What went wrong:** the hosted Supabase MCP (HTTP + OAuth) failed in Claude Code with "Resource must be a valid MCP endpoint" when the URL carried `?project_ref`. Fixed by switching to the stdio server through `scripts/supabase-mcp.mjs`, which reads the token from `.env.local`, so `.mcp.json` holds no secrets.
- **Decisions:** demo RLS = read-only for anon, writes only via service role; tightening is logged as an open decision for M7. Access token is project-scoped with a short expiry (24/10), with a reminder in the README and CLAUDE.md. The Stop hook was added last so it wouldn't fire on every intermediate turn of the setup.
